## What is Python

 - Originally python was written using the  "C" language. C is a compiled language and faster than any other programming language. But on the other hand, Python is an interpreted language. Due to that reason, it's slower than the C language. But it's easy to understand.

 - Even though python is slow when compared to C. Python is involved in many areas and applications such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
