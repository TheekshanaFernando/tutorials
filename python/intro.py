# 1.
# comments
# this is a comment - comments are used to store descriptions about current implementations
# comments are not interprete by the interperter


# example
# following line will print "hello world" to the console
print("hello world")

# but the following is not going to print as it commented
# print("let's learn python")


# there are two types of comments
# these are single line comments

'''
This is a multilined comments
same as single lined comments nothing inside the comment will be excluded on runtime
print("i'm inside a multilined comment")

'''

# 2.
# indentation

# there are more rules to consider when programming with python
# a indentation usually means a 4 spacebar presses, "    " or a tab press
# a indentaion will help the program to understand the respective command block
# example


def add():
    # following print is place with an indentaion so the program can understand
    # the print() belongs to the add function
    print(2+4)


# do not worry if you cannot understand how functions work. there is a dedicated module for functions

# 3.
# variables

# variales plays a major when it comes to programming. variables can be used to store data in the runtime.
# Unlike other programming languges you do not need to mention the type of the variable. you simply can
# declare the variable with the required name.

# example

name = "Sam Perera"
age = 65
electricity_bill = 3400.45

# there are rules when declaring variables.
# the are,

# A variable cannot start with a number or a symbol
# variables can have symbols and numbers after the first character.
# Variables can have both Lower case (simple) and Upper case (capital) letters
# Variables are case-sensitive
