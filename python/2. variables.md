# Varaibles

## 1. Creating variables

Let's compare Python with a another high level language to understand the differences when declaring a variable.

- C++
```cpp
int value = 4;
value = "sam";
```
<sub>*Produce an Error, mentioning that value is a integer and cannot be used as a string*</sub>

- Python
```python
value = 4
value = "sam"
```
*Works fine*

Therefore, a program like following is possible.

```python
value = "Ann"
value = 10

print(value + 5)
```

The variable will forget the value "Ann" and assign 10. Then prints the value
