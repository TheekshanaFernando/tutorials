# Variables

## 1. Creating variables

Let's compare Python with a another high level language to understand the differences when declaring a variable.

- C++
```cpp
int value = 4;
value = "sam";
```
<sub>*:x:&nbsp;Produce an Error, mentioning that value is a integer and cannot be used as a string*</sub>

- Python
```python
value = 4
value = "sam"
```
<sub>*:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;Works fine*</sub>

Therefore, a program like following is possible.

```python
value = "Ann"
value = 10

print(value + 5)
```

The variable will forget the value "Ann" and assign 10. Then prints the value

Remember the variables are case sensitive.

Example

```python
age = 15
Age = 15

print(age)
print(Age)
```

Two variables are look similar but cases are different. Therefore they will act like two different variables.

## 2. Case styles

Case styles are best practices when declaring variables. Using a proper case style allows peer developers to understand the program easily.

There are 3 main types. They are,

-camelCase
-PascalCase
-snake_case

let's apply case style for a variable named <code>max count</code>.

```python
#camelCase
maxCount = 1000

#PascalCase
MaxCount = 1000

#snake_case
max_count = 1000

#also in when declaring a Constant variable, usuallly we only use Uppercase letters
#Example

PIE = 3.14
SECONDSPERMINUTE = 60
