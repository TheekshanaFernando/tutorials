# 1. Comments
```python
#this is a comment - comments are used to store descriptions about current implementations
# comments are not interprete by the interperter
```

Example

Following line will print "hello world" to the console
```python 
print("hello world")
```

But the following is not going to print as it commented
```python 
print("this will not print to the console")
```


There are two types of comments
 1. Following is a single line comment
```python
#this is a comment
```

 2. Following is multi lined comment
```python
'''This is a multilined comments
same as single lined comments nothing inside the comment will be excluded on runtime
print("i'm inside a multilined comment")'''

```

# 2. Indentation

There are more rules to consider when programming with pytho, A indentation usually means a 4 spacebar presses, "    " or a tab press. A indentaion will help the program to understand the respective command block

Example

```python
def add():
    # following print is place with an indentaion so the program can understand
    # the print() belongs to the add function
    print(2+4)
```

Do not worry if you cannot understand how functions work. there is a dedicated module for functions

# 3. Variables

Variales plays a major when it comes to programming. variables can be used to store data in the runtime. Unlike other programming languges you do not need to mention the type of the variable. You simply can declare the variable with the required name.

Example

```python
name = "Sam Perera"
age = 65
electricity_bill = 3400.45
```

There are rules when declaring variables. They are,
 - A variable cannot start with a number or a symbol
 - Variables can have symbols and numbers after the first character.
 - Variables can have both Lower case (simple) and Upper case (capital) letters
 - Variables are case-sensitive
