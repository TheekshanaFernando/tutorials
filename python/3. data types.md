# Data Types

## 1. Categories
Data types are one of the key concepts in the world of programming. There are a plenty of data types built-in with the language. 

Those data types can be categorized as follows,

| Category      | Data type / types |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Text      | str    |
| Numeric    | int , float complex        |
| Sequence | list, tuple , range |
|Mapping | dict|
|Sets| set, frozenset|
|Boolean | bool |
|Binary | bytes , bytearray,memoryview|

### 1.1 Text

Texts are prgrammically known as Strings. There two types in python world of texts.

1. Strings (str)

#### Strings

As mentioned a string is a simple text.
Examples

```python

name = "James Newcastle"
eucation = "Harvard University"

```

### 1.2 Numeric

Python numeric data types are as follows,

1. Integers (int)
2. Floating point numbers (float)
3. Complex (complex)

#### Integers

Integers are whole numbers including both positive and negetive numbers.
Examples

```python

age = 23
egg_count = 450
freezerTemp = -18

```

#### Floating point numbers

Floats are values with decimal point including both positive and negetive numbers.
Examples

```python

PIE = 3.14
WorldPopulationInBillion = 7.73

```

#### Complex Number

Complex numbers often used in higher mathematical calculations.
Examples

Squre root of a negative number can be considered as a complex number

```python

x = 3j

```

### 1.3 Sequence

Sequence are used to store data as in a collection. Elements inside a sequence can be access with indexes starting from 0. Therfore the first element will be at 0th index and the last element will be the length of the sequence -1.

1. list 
2. tuple
3. range

#### list

A list can have data of any type. "[]" brackets are used to define a list.
Examples

```python

sample_list = ["strings",3,6,3.14,[],4j]

```

Elements inside a list can access using "[]" after the variable name.

```python
students = ["Ann","John","Kamal", "Elton"]

firstStudent = students[0]

print("first student : " + firstStudent)
print("second student : " + students[1])

```


#### Tuple

Both tuple and list are similar in appearence but tuple is faster than a list and requires less space.
Examples

```python

sample_list = ("strings",3,6,3.14,[],4j)

```

Simillarly, elements inside a tuple can access using [] after the variable name.

```python
students = ("Ann","John","Kamal", "Elton")

firstStudent = students[0]

print("first student : " + firstStudent)
print("second student : " + students[1])

```

### range

A range is completly different in nature. A range will only accept integers.

Example

```python
#range with integers from 0 to 9
range1 =  range(10)

#range with even numbers
range_even = range(0,10,2)

#range in descending order
range_desc =  range(10,0,-1)
```

Similarly you can access elements inside the range using "[]" after the variable name.

Example
```python

values  = range(10)
print(values[0])
print(values[1])
print(values[2])
print(values[3])
```


### 1.4 Mapping

A map also used as a structure to store data. But instead of using indexes to access the elements inside the structure we use keywords. A map is also known as a Dictionery in python.

1. Dictionery

#### Dictionery

A dictionery will be sourounded by "{}". Following are few examples,
Examples

```python

sample_dict = {"name":}

```

Elements inside a list can access using "[]" after the variable name.

```python
students = ["Ann","John","Kamal", "Elton"]

firstStudent = students[0]

print("first student : " + firstStudent)
print("second student : " + students[1])

```
